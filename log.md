### Day 0: January 24, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Two small examples - Turtle and Random Walks.

**Thoughts:** I need to do more functions.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 25, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Library code - learning classes.

**Thoughts:** Some extras could be added  - maybe list is not good for the Book class...

### Day 3: January 27, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Exploratory Data Analysis - learning functions, charts. 

**Thoughts:** Looks rather affordable, but need to spend more time on that.

### Day 4: January 28, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Drawing painting - dots from Hirst pallette with Dr. Angela Yu. 

**Thoughts:** Working in Pycharm, installation of packages, Turtle package used

### Day 5: January 29, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: EDA - working on scatterplots with labels. 

**Thoughts:** It is still unclear what to do with overlapped labels and need nicer-looking charts (fonts, colors, sizes)

### Day 7: January 31, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Linear regression - insurance expenses vs age. 

**Thoughts:** Slicing the table was not obvious.
